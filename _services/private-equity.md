## Phase 2: Roadshow and Investor Shortlisting
In this phase, Banyan helps the client decide on the kind of private equity funds who will be the right investors for the client, holds initial discussions with the investors, helps the client have road-shows with meeting the potential investors and advises the client to prioritize among the investors to create a shortlist.
